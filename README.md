# hello-world-spring_boot-angularjs
With this little program I would like to gain my first experience with Spring boot as backend and AngularJS as frontend.

For this I have the instructions from
https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-angular-web
used and necessary adjustments made in order to be able to start the application completely.
